# SOMA - Mycelium Water Filtration System

### Introduction
Welcome to the repository for SOMA, a pioneering project from the University of Washington focused on utilizing mycelium for water filtration. Our mission is to integrate mycelium filtration pods into constructed wetland ecosystems, offering a natural and efficient solution to mitigate the impacts of excessive nitrates, phosphates, and oils from agricultural and stormwater runoff. This repository contains the source code and resources for the SOMA project's official website.
