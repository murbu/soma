        <h1>MYCOFILTRATION PRESENTS A SOLUTION</h1>
        <p>Mycelium is the fiber of the mushroom body, with a special capability to absorb oils, heavy
            metals, excess nitrates, phosphates, and other waste contaminants in water and sequester them within their tissue. Fungal
            hyphae, structures within the mycelium system, have a diameter of 4-6 micrometers and actively work to filter out contaminants.
            Introducing layered mycelium mats to bodies of water impacted by the previously mentioned pollutants will decrease the
            concentration of particulate matter in the water in which they are placed. These mats are easily transportable and could be applied to
            local water ways to improve water quality and consequently environmental health.</p>

        <p>We propose a system that organically embeds mycelium filtration pods into constructed wetland ecosystems to remediate the effects
            of excessive nitrates, phosphates, and oils from agricultural and stormwater runoff.</p>

            <p>1. Projected to slow the flow of water which will allow for an increase of
                phytoremediation and a decrease of flooding <br>
                2. Demonstrated potential in lowering phosphate and nitrate levels in polluted water<br>
                3. Shows potential in increasing the carbon sequestering capability of wetlands</p>
